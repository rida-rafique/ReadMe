##About
<p>Formulating new recipes is more of an art than a science. We will create a software application that will be using a large dataset of recipes from all over the world to intelligently generate new and improved recipes having not only generated taste but will also contain required nutritional value. <p/>
**Recipe Evolution**
<p>A recipe evaluation form is an essential tool for a chef to maintain consistency within his restaurant. Without regular evaluations of existing recipes on the menu a variety of issues will crop up which will affect the consistency of your recipes and the guest's satisfaction. However, in this we will highlight what is evaluated in a meal, defining the standards and speciation of the prepared dishes.</P>

#Evolution
  <p>Evolution is a process that helps individuals to adapt themselves to the constantly changing environment. An Evolutionary Algorithm, a subset of Evolutionary Computing, is a stochastic search for an optimum solution to a given problem. Due to its efficient nature and robust behavior, it has become an efficient means of the problem-solving method used for global optimization of problems.</p>
 #Issues and Challenges
  <p>Some of the listed ingredients sometimes are not able to prepare or use for cooking for some reasons:</p>
  <ul><li>Allergies</ul></li>
  <li>Personal preference</li>
  <li>	Or some ingredients are not available in the kitchen</li>
  <p>We try to switch ingredients that help to keep the same taste or texture. For that purpose we use different methodologies </p>
  <ul><li>	Genetic Algorithm which model genetic evolution.</ul><li>
<li>	Genetic programming which is based on genetic algorithms, but individuals is programs (represented as trees).</li>
